# Build Process

The Mac, Windows and Linux versions of Peerio can be built using `nwjs` (formerly `node-webkit`). 

To build, install [node.js and npm](http://nodejs.org), as well as the [Transifex client](http://docs.transifex.com/client/setup/) with a `~/.transifexrc` file for user credentials. Within the root project directory, run `npm install`. Then, run `gulp build`. This command will generate working Mac, Windows and Linux builds. 

Mac and Linux users may want to comment out the `winIco` line in the `build` task in `gulpfile.js` (~ L207), since it is not useful to them and will require installing Wine.

## Mac

To run, simply double-click the package.

## Windows

Run Peerio.exe. `nw.pak` and other files generated by `nwjs` must be in the same directory as the executable. 

## Linux

From the command line, run `./PATH/TO/EXECUTABLE/Peerio`.

`nw.pak` and other files generated by `nwjs` must be in the same directory as the executable. 

# Additional (Internal) Tooling

To bump the version number to a patch version, run `gulp bump`.

Before doing releases, make sure to run `gulp update` to update dependencies and translation copy. 

Mac OS code signing can be done with `gulp sign`, provided the right Developer ID certificate is installed and configured as an environment variable.
