# Build Process

The Mac, Windows and Linux versions of Peerio can be built using `nwjs` (formerly `node-webkit`). 

To build, install Node.js and NPM. Within the root project directory, run `npm install`. Then, run `grunt build`. This command will generate working Mac, Windows and Linux builds. 

## Mac

To run, simply double-click the package.

## Windows

Run Peerio.exe. `nw.pak` and other files generated by `nwjs` must be in the same directory as the executable. 

## Linux

`nw.pak` and other files generated by `nwjs` must be in the same directory as the executable. 

# Additional (Internal) Tooling

To bump the version number to a patch version, run `grunt bump`.

Before doing releases, make sure to run `grunt update` to update dependencies and translation copy. 

Mac OS code signing can be done with `gulp sign`, provided the right Developer ID certificate is installed and configured as an environment variable.
