# Peerio - Secure messaging and file sharing made easy.

Peerio integrates cloud storage with a messaging platform so you can safely keep your important files online and ready to send from anywhere. With end-to-end encryption, messages and files are encrypted before leaving your computer and can only be read by you and your recipients. 

Peerio beta is available for Chrome, Windows and Mac. Coming soon to Android and iOS. Build instructions for linux can be found [here](BUILD.md)

For all features please visit our [website](https://www.peerio.com). For support and frequently asked questions, please see our [support portal](https://support.peerio.com).
